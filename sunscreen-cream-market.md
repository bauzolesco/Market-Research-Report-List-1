<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sunscreen Cream Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Sunscreens</li><li>Physical Sunscreens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sunscreen cream market is primarily divided into two types: chemical and physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens absorb UV radiation through their active ingredients, transforming it into heat, which is then released from the skin. They typically have a lightweight feel and can be more aesthetically pleasing for everyday use. In contrast, physical sunscreens contain mineral-based active ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, providing a physical barrier that reflects UV rays. These are often preferred for sensitive skin and offer immediate protection upon application.</p></p>
